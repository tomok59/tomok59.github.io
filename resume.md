## EDUCATION
Bachelor of Science (B.S.) - Cognitive Science with a Specialization in Machine Learning and Neural Computation, Minor in Data Science, Minor in Mathematics
University of California San Diego, San Diego, CA        	             Sep 2020 - March 2024

### My Academic Path
I really enjoy machine learning as a topic as the possibilities are endless! I added a minor in data science to improve my coding skills and learn the background knowledge needed before using machine learning (i.e. data cleaning, data structures, etc.). The minor is the same classes as the major, without the final project that data science majors are required to do. I have taken two data optimization classes to earn more about the math behind a lot of machine learning algorithms. This made it so I had enough credit to add a math minor to my degree. Some of my projects I have worked on can be found on my website linked at the top of my resume.

## Relevant Experiences:

### UCSD Lab Assistant: Fall Quarter 2023
Working on Data Analysis with Dr. Christine Johnson

Worked on second-by-second data regarding dolphin behavior. The dataset was about 65000 data points and required extensive data cleaning. I then have run data analysis, hypothesis testing and other statistical test to determine whether some of the associations in the data was random or not. The findings I have made should be published in a scientific paper later this year. 

### UCSD Instructional Assistant (IA)
I really enjoy teaching and being able to pass on knowledge. Being able to help someone succeed in always something that I enjoy doing. Below are some experiences that I have teaching!
#### Fall Quarter 2022
Taught COGS 100, Cyborgs Now and in the Future with Professor David Kirsh
This class is about how do we define a “cyborg,” also covered AI and the implication of it in the future. Being an IA required me to know the material to teach it, hold office hours and grade student’s work.
