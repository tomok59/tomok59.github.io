# Catan AI

We created a Q-learning agent that learned to play Catan and compared various hyperparameters in the learning process. If you want to run the code as given, you can just run the QLearningGame.py file.

## Catan Implementation

This was implemented using an adapted version of the Catan AI developed by Karan Vombatkere. The original is accessible at the link below:
