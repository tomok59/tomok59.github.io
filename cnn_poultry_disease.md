This study applies Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to a large dataset of chicken excrement images for early detection of avian diseases, a critical issue in poultry agriculture. The dataset, from the Kaggle repository "Poultry Pathology Visual Dataset," includes images from Tanzania, classified into four categories: Healthy, Coccidiosis, NewCastle Disease, and Salmonella. 
We developed a sophisticated neural network, LNN-PDI, and used augmentation techniques to handle real-world variability. Optimization methods, including a transition to ADAMW and experimentation with different pooling and activation functions, were employed for model refinement. Despite computational constraints, our model achieved an accuracy of 89%, demonstrating the potential of CNNs in disease detection. Our findings highlight the importance of balanced datasets, strategic optimization, and adequate computational resources in developing effective tools for early avian disease detection.
