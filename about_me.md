## About me

Welcome to this page, I hope you are having a good day.

Here I am going to explore some of my passions, motivations and general interests.

I am passionate about motorcycles and cars but more generally anything win an engine. Being on the motorcyle, you always see me with a giant smile. It is such a freeing feeling.

I also enjoy playing tennis and soccer. I have been playing tennis since I was a child, and more recently I have been learninng to play soccer. Allez les bleus! 

I am also a bassist, I like to groove 

I also love to play board games, hence the Catan-AI project. I also do poker nights with my friends 

I also like nature, I go hiking, camping and seeing some of the natural wonders. One of my favorite places I have been is Sequoia National Park, seeing trees so big is magical
