## About me

Welcome to the about me page :)

Here I am going to explore some of my passions, motivations and general interests.

I am passionate about motorcycles and cars but more generally anything win an engine. Being on the motorcyle, you always see me with a giant smile. It is such a freeing feeling.

I also enjoy playing tennis and soccer. I have been playing tennis since I was a child, and more recently I have been learning to play soccer. Allez les bleus! 

I am always looking to learn something new -  right now I am learning to play music through the bass.

I also love to play board games, hence the Catan-AI project. My favorites are 7 Wonders, Splendor, Ticket to Ride, and card games.

I also like nature, I go hiking, camping and seeing some of the natural wonders. One of my favorite places I have been is Sequoia National Park, seeing trees so big is magical
